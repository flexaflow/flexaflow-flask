Theme Static Files
==================

Theme static files are stored in this directory.  

When the application runs, the main program automatically copies the theme's static files into the application's static directory, organized under the theme's name.  

To use static files from a theme in your application, reference them like this:

    /static/<theme_name>/example.css
